# AI Agent Systems & Optimization Projects

This repository contains a collection of AI agent implementations developed as part of advanced coursework in Artificial Intelligence. The projects focus on building agents that can reason, plan, act, and evaluate outcomes in complex and constrained environments.

Together, these projects demonstrate core principles behind modern agentic systems, including search-based decision making, optimization in large state spaces, and probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Little-Go AI Agent (Search & Game Playing)
**Folder:** `go-ai-agent/`

An autonomous game-playing AI agent designed for the 5×5 Go environment. The agent reasons over future game states, plans optimal moves, and executes decisions under strict rule and time constraints.

**Key concepts:**
- Minimax search with alpha-beta pruning  
- Heuristic evaluation and long-horizon planning  
- Performance optimization through search-space pruning

### 2. 3D Traveling Salesman Optimization Agent
**Folder:** `genetic-algorithm-tsp/`

An optimization agent that solves the 3D Traveling Salesman Problem using a Genetic Algorithm implemented from scratch. The agent iteratively improves solutions across generations to converge on near-optimal routes.

**Key concepts:**
- Population-based optimization  
- Fitness evaluation, crossover, and mutation  
- Planning in large combinatorial search spaces

### 3. POMDP-Based Temporal Reasoning & Speech Inference Agent
**Folder:** `pomdp-reasoning/`

A probabilistic AI agent that reasons under partial observability using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The system infers hidden state sequences from noisy observations using dynamic programming.

**Key concepts:**
- Probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty modeling  
- Viterbi decoding for sequence inference  
- Applications to temporal reasoning and speech recognition
